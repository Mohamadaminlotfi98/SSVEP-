# SSVEP
SSVEP_FBCNN_12class is a deep learning model designed for classifying 12 different SSVEP signals, which are a type of brain signal generated in response to flickering light at specific frequencies. This model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known as the filter bank CNN (FBCNN). Here's a breakdown of the key components and their roles:

SSVEP Signals: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are brain signals elicited when a person views a flickering light at a particular frequency. The frequency of the SSVEP signal corresponds to the flickering frequency of the light source.

Classification of 12 Classes: The primary goal of the SSVEP_FBCNN_12class model is to classify SSVEP signals into one of 12 different classes. Each class may correspond to a specific frequency of flickering light, and the model's purpose is to determine which class the SSVEP signal belongs to.

Deep Learning Model: The model is built as a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep learning architecture commonly used for image and signal classification tasks. In this case, it's tailored for SSVEP signal classification.

Filter Bank CNN (FBCNN): The FBCNN architecture is a variation of the standard CNN. It consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting relevant features from the input SSVEP signals, while the fully connected layer performs the actual classification task. The term "filter bank" implies that the CNN uses a set of filters to extract different features from the input.

Training Data: The SSVEP_FBCNN_12class model is trained on a labeled dataset of SSVEP signals. This training data likely includes a wide range of SSVEP signals, each labeled with the class it belongs to. The model learns to recognize patterns and features in these signals that distinguish between the 12 different classes.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs): SSVEP signals and models like SSVEP_FBCNN_12class are crucial components of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). BCIs are devices that allow individuals to communicate or control external devices using their thoughts, often by translating brain signals into commands or actions. The high accuracy of this model in classifying SSVEP signals makes it a valuable tool for developing BCIs that are more reliable and responsive.

Overall, SSVEP_FBCNN_12class represents a specialized and powerful tool for the field of brain-computer interfaces, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of these interfaces in various applications, including communication and device control.
